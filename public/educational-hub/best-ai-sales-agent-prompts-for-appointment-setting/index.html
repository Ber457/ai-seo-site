<h2>Introduction: The New Frontier of AI-Powered Appointment Setting</h2>
<p>The landscape of sales outreach has transformed dramatically with the integration of AI agents into appointment setting workflows. Today&#39;s sales teams are leveraging sophisticated AI systems to qualify leads, engage prospects, and secure valuable meetings for closers—all without human intervention at every step.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s a critical element that determines success or failure in this new paradigm: the quality of your prompts.</p>
<p>Poor prompts lead to robotic conversations, missed opportunities, and wasted resources. Exceptional prompts create natural dialogues that prospects respond to, driving higher conversion rates and more qualified appointments.</p>
<p>In this comprehensive guide, we&#39;ll explore the science and art of crafting high-performing AI sales agent prompts specifically designed for appointment setting. Whether you&#39;re just beginning to experiment with AI sales tools or looking to optimize your existing conversational flows, you&#39;ll find actionable strategies, templates, and real-world examples to enhance your results.</p>
<h2>Understanding AI Sales Agents: Myths vs. Facts</h2>
<p>Before diving into prompt engineering, let&#39;s clarify what AI sales agents can and cannot do when it comes to appointment setting.</p>
<h3>Myth #1: AI Agents Can Completely Replace Human SDRs</h3>
<p><strong>FACT:</strong> AI agents excel at specific tasks within the appointment setting process but work best as augmentation to human teams. They can handle initial outreach, qualification, and scheduling, freeing human SDRs to focus on complex prospects and strategic activities.</p>
<h3>Myth #2: All You Need Is a Basic Script</h3>
<p><strong>FACT:</strong> Simple scripts produce robotic interactions. Effective AI agents require sophisticated prompt engineering with multiple conversation paths, objection handling sequences, and contextual awareness triggers.</p>
<h3>Myth #3: AI Agents Can&#39;t Sound Natural or Build Rapport</h3>
<p><strong>FACT:</strong> Modern AI with properly crafted prompts can create surprisingly human-like conversations. While they don&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; emotions, they can recognize emotional cues and respond appropriately when programmed with empathy triggers and personalization variables.</p>
<h3>Myth #4: You Set It and Forget It</h3>
<p><strong>FACT:</strong> Successful AI appointment setting requires continuous testing, analysis, and refinement. Top-performing teams analyze conversation logs weekly and iterate prompts based on performance data.</p>
<h3>Myth #5: AI Can Only Handle the Simplest Prospects</h3>
<p><strong>FACT:</strong> With advanced prompt engineering, AI agents can navigate complex industry conversations, handle sophisticated objections, and qualify prospects based on multiple criteria—even in B2B and enterprise contexts.</p>
<h2>The Anatomy of High-Converting AI Appointment Setting Prompts</h2>
<p>The most effective AI sales agent prompts for appointment setting share several key components. Let&#39;s break down the essential elements:</p>
<h3>1. Context Setting</h3>
<p>Your AI needs to understand who it is, who it&#39;s representing, and what it&#39;s trying to accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>You are an AI sales development representative for [Company Name], a provider of [brief solution description]. Your goal is to schedule a 30-minute demonstration with qualified decision-makers who are experiencing [specific pain points]. You should introduce yourself as [AI Name] from [Company Name].
</code></pre>
<h3>2. Prospect Information Integration</h3>
<p>Instruct your AI on how to use available data about the prospect.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Incorporate the following prospect information naturally into your conversation:
- Prospect Name: {first_name} {last_name}
- Company: {company_name}
- Title: {job_title}
- Industry: {industry}
- Recent company news: {recent_news}
- LinkedIn information: {linkedin_insights}
</code></pre>
<h3>3. Conversation Flow Structure</h3>
<p>Map out the logical progression of an effective appointment-setting conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Follow this conversation structure:
1. Brief personalized introduction with a relevant insight about their company or industry
2. Value proposition statement tied to prospect&#39;s likely challenges
3. Open-ended question to confirm pain points
4. Qualification questions (if prospect engages)
5. Propose meeting with clear benefit statement
6. Handle objections (if any)
7. Confirm and schedule the appointment
</code></pre>
<h3>4. Qualification Criteria</h3>
<p>Define what makes a prospect qualified for an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Qualify prospects based on these criteria:
- Decision-making authority (must be director-level or higher)
- Current process challenges (manually managing [specific process])
- Timeline (looking to implement a solution within 3-6 months)
- Budget (has allocated resources for [solution category])
- Company size (50+ employees)
</code></pre>
<h3>5. Objection Handling Instructions</h3>
<p>Prepare your AI to address common resistance points.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>When handling objections:
- Acknowledge the concern
- Provide a brief, value-focused response
- Ask a follow-up question to continue the conversation
- Never argue or appear defensive

Common objections to prepare for:
- &quot;Send me some information&quot; → Agree, but suggest a quick call first to personalize materials
- &quot;We&#39;re already using [competitor]&quot; → Acknowledge and ask about specific challenges with current solution
- &quot;No budget right now&quot; → Understand timeline for next budget cycle and suggest ROI conversation
- &quot;Too busy right now&quot; → Offer flexible scheduling and emphasize time-saving benefits
</code></pre>
<h3>6. Personality and Tone Guidelines</h3>
<p>Define how your AI agent should &quot;sound&quot; to create an engaging, brand-appropriate experience.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Communication style:
- Friendly and conversational, but professional
- Brief messages (1-3 sentences per response)
- Use light humor where appropriate
- Avoid technical jargon unless prospect uses it first
- Express enthusiasm without excessive punctuation or capitalization
- Match prospect&#39;s communication pace and style
</code></pre>
<h3>7. Closing and Follow-up Instructions</h3>
<p>Direct your AI on how to secure and confirm appointments.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>When the prospect shows interest in meeting:
1. Offer 2-3 specific time slots (e.g., &quot;Would Tuesday at 2pm or Wednesday at 10am work better?&quot;)
2. Mention who will be joining from your company
3. Briefly outline what will be covered in the meeting
4. Confirm the prospect&#39;s preferred meeting method (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
5. Send calendar invitation with meeting link and agenda
6. Send confirmation message 24 hours before the appointment
</code></pre>

<h2>Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques for Higher Conversion</h2>
<p>Beyond basic templates, these advanced techniques can significantly improve your AI&#39;s appointment setting effectiveness:</p>
<h3>Persona-Based Prompting</h3>
<p>Instruct your AI to adapt based on prospect personas.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Adjust your approach based on the prospect&#39;s persona:

For Technical Decision-Makers:

- Use practical examples rather than strategic benefits
</code></pre>
<h3>Multi-Thread Conversation Management</h3>
<p>Enable your AI to maintain context across multiple interaction points.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Maintain conversation context across interactions:
- Reference previous conversation points naturally (e.g., &quot;When we last spoke, you mentioned...&quot;)
- Track which qualification questions have been answered
- Note previously mentioned objections and avoid repeating addressed points
- Acknowledge time gaps between messages appropriately
- Record and reference prospect-specific pain points in future messages
</code></pre>
<h3>Micro-Commitment Sequences</h3>
<p>Direct your AI to use small agreements to build toward appointment setting.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Use a micro-commitment approach:
1. Start with an easy question that prospects will likely agree with (e.g., &quot;Are you still responsible for [relevant area]?&quot;)
2. Follow with a pain point confirmation (e.g., &quot;Many [job title] tell me that [common pain point] is frustrating. Is that something you&#39;ve experienced?&quot;)
3. Ask a problem impact question (e.g., &quot;How has that affected your [relevant business process]?&quot;)
4. Suggest a potential solution approach (e.g., &quot;We&#39;ve helped similar companies address that by...&quot;)
5. Propose the meeting as a natural next step
</code></pre>
<h3>Pattern Interruption Techniques</h3>
<p>Help your AI stand out from typical sales outreach.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Use these pattern interruption approaches:
- Start with an unexpected question rather than a standard introduction
- Reference a surprising industry statistic or trend
- Begin with a brief customer success story with compelling metrics
- Use a &quot;permission-based&quot; opener (e.g., &quot;Quick question - would it be helpful if I shared how companies like yours are [solving specific problem]?&quot;)
- Lead with a counterintuitive insight about their industry or challenge
</code></pre>
<h3>Time-Based Contextual Adaptations</h3>
<p>Enable your AI to consider timing factors in its approach.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Adapt your approach based on timing contexts:
- Beginning of quarter: Focus on planning and strategic implementation
- End of quarter: Emphasize quick wins and immediate value
- Monday messages: Keep brief, focus on scheduling later in week
- Friday outreach: Suggest meeting next week, use more casual tone
- Seasonal business factors: Reference relevant seasonal challenges
- Recent industry news: Connect outreach to timely developments
</code></pre>
<h2>Real-World Examples: AI Appointment Setting Prompts That Converted</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s examine successful prompts used by real companies (with identifying details changed):</p>
<h3>Example 1: SaaS Sales Enablement Platform</h3>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>You are a sales development representative for TechBoost, a sales enablement platform that helps B2B sales teams increase conversion rates by 27% through AI-powered coaching and real-time guidance.

When contacting {first_name}, who is a {job_title} at {company_name}, reference that they recently posted on LinkedIn about scaling their sales team. Position our solution as a way to ensure consistent performance across new hires.

Focus on these pain points:
- Inconsistent sales performance across team members
- Long ramp time for new sales hires
- Difficulty enforcing sales methodology adherence
- Limited visibility into conversation quality

If they show interest, aim to schedule a 30-minute demonstration with our product specialist, emphasizing that we&#39;ll customize the demo to their sales process.

Qualification criteria:
- Sales team size (5+ is ideal)
- Current sales enablement tools
- Sales methodology in use
- New hire onboarding challenges

Handle &quot;send me information&quot; requests by offering to send case studies from their industry after a brief call to understand their specific challenges.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Conversion Rate:</strong> 22% (more than double the previous generic prompt)</p>
<p><strong>Why It Worked:</strong> The prompt incorporated personalized LinkedIn information, targeted specific pain points that resonated with sales leaders, and included a strategic response to the common &quot;send me information&quot; objection.</p>
<h3>Example 2: Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management</h3>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>You are an AI assistant for MedCycle Solutions, which helps medical practices reduce claim denials by 32% and accelerate reimbursements through our AI-powered revenue cycle management platform.

When speaking with {first_name}, who manages a {practice_type} with approximately {patient_volume} monthly patient visits, be conversational but professional. Reference the recent changes to {relevant_insurance} reimbursement policies that are affecting their specialty.

Your goal is to schedule a Revenue Impact Analysis with our healthcare financial consultant.

Key talking points:
- Average claim denial rates in their specialty (national average: 17%)
- Typical revenue leakage from coding errors (5-9% for their specialty)
- Staff time spent on manual claim reconciliation
- Compliance risks with changing regulations

Qualification requirements:
- Practice size (3+ providers ideal)
- Current RCM process (in-house or outsourced)
- Primary insurance payers
- Current denial rate if known

Use medical terminology appropriate for administrative staff, not clinical language. Emphasize HIPAA compliance and integration with major EMR systems.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Conversion Rate:</strong> 18% (35% higher than industry average)</p>
<p><strong>Why It Worked:</strong> The prompt demonstrated deep industry knowledge, referenced relevant regulatory changes, and offered a specific value proposition (Revenue Impact Analysis) rather than a generic meeting.</p>
<h3>Example 3: Manufacturing Equipment Maintenance Solution</h3>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>You represent PredictiveCare, which helps manufacturing operations reduce unplanned downtime by 43% through our IoT-connected predictive maintenance platform.

When contacting {first_name} at {company_name}, a {manufacturing_type} facility, mention that companies with similar production lines have seen maintenance costs decrease by 26% while extending equipment lifespan.

Your conversation objective is to schedule a 45-minute assessment with our industrial systems specialist.

Focus areas:
- Current maintenance approach (reactive, preventive, or predictive)
- Annual unplanned downtime incidents and costs
- Age and types of critical equipment
- Current monitoring capabilities
- Integration with existing CMMS/ERP systems

If they mention budget constraints, discuss our ROI calculator that shows typical payback periods of 4-7 months based on their downtime costs.

For technical contacts, emphasize sensor specifications and data security. For operations managers, focus on uptime improvements and maintenance staff efficiency.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Conversion Rate:</strong> 15% (3x improvement over previous outreach)</p>
<p><strong>Why It Worked:</strong> The prompt included industry-specific metrics, adapted messaging based on the contact&#39;s role, and provided a clear ROI-focused response to budget objections.</p>
<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid in AI Appointment Setting Prompts</h2>
<p>Even sophisticated teams make these errors when developing AI appointment setting prompts:</p>
<h3>1. Over-Promising Capabilities</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Instructing AI to make claims beyond what your product delivers or what the AI can realistically handle.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Be precise about what your AI can offer and claim. Set clear boundaries and stick to factual statements about your solution.</p>
<p><strong>Example of what NOT to do:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Tell the prospect our solution will definitely increase their revenue by at least 50% and that you can customize a proposal on the spot based on their specific needs.
</code></pre>
<h3>2. Insufficient Objection Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Creating prompts with limited or shallow responses to common objections.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Develop detailed, nuanced responses to at least 5-7 of the most common objections specific to your industry and offering.</p>
<p><strong>Example of what NOT to do:</strong></p>
<pre><code>If they object, just emphasize our key benefits again and push for the meeting.
</code></pre>
<h3>3. Ignoring Conversation Flow</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Designing prompts that follow rigid scripts rather than natural conversation patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create branching dialogue options that respond to different prospect reactions and allow for multiple conversation paths.</p>
<p><strong>Example of what NOT to do:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Regardless of what the prospect says, follow steps 1-5 in exact order and ask for the meeting after step 5.
</code></pre>
<h3>4. Lack of Personalization Instructions</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Failing to guide the AI on how to incorporate available prospect data.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Specify exactly how to use different data points throughout the conversation to create a personalized experience.</p>
<p><strong>Example of what NOT to do:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Mention the prospect&#39;s name at the beginning.
</code></pre>
<p>Instead, provide specific guidance on using multiple data points contextually throughout the conversation.</p>
<h3>5. Too Much Jargon or Technical Language</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Loading prompts with industry jargon that may confuse prospects or make the AI sound robotic.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Instruct your AI to match the prospect&#39;s level of technical language and to explain concepts in simple terms first.</p>
<p><strong>Example of what NOT to do:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Explain our proprietary hexacore integration framework and its asynchronous data parsing capabilities.
</code></pre>
<h3>6. Missing Follow-Up Instructions</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Focusing only on the initial conversation without guiding the AI on next steps.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Include clear instructions for confirming appointments, sending reminders, and handling rescheduling requests.</p>
<p><strong>Example of what NOT to do:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Once they agree to a meeting, end the conversation.
</code></pre>
<h3>7. Neglecting Ethical Guidelines</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Not establishing clear ethical boundaries for your AI&#39;s communication.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Include specific instructions about transparency, data usage, and appropriate persuasion techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Example of what to include:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Always identify yourself as an AI assistant. Never claim to be human or use deceptive tactics. Do not make claims about solving problems until you&#39;ve confirmed the prospect actually has those problems.
</code></pre>
<h2>Measuring and Optimizing Your AI Appointment Setting Prompts</h2>
<p>The most successful AI appointment setting programs implement systematic testing and optimization. Here&#39;s a practical framework:</p>
<h3>Key Performance Indicators to Track</h3>
<p><strong>1. Conversation Engagement Rate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Percentage of prospects who respond after initial outreach</li>
<li>Average number of exchanges before conversion or disengagement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Qualification Accuracy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Percentage of prospects correctly qualified according to criteria</li>
<li>False positive rate (unqualified prospects scheduled)</li>
<li>False negative rate (qualified prospects not scheduled)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Appointment Set Rate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Percentage of conversations that result in scheduled appointments</li>
<li>Conversion rate by prospect segment/persona</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Appointment Show Rate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Percentage of scheduled appointments that actually occur</li>
<li>Cancellation and reschedule rates</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Conversation Quality Metrics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Average sentiment score in prospect responses</li>
<li>Objection frequency and resolution rates</li>
<li>Question-answer relevance scores</li>
</ul>
<h3>A/B Testing Framework for Prompt Optimization</h3>
<p>Follow this process to continuously improve your prompts:</p>
<p><strong>1. Identify Test Variables</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose one element to test (e.g., opening line, value proposition, objection handling)</li>
<li>Create variation A (control) and variation B (test)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Define Success Metrics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Select primary KPI (e.g., appointment set rate)</li>
<li>Set secondary metrics (e.g., engagement rate, sentiment)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Implement Split Testing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Run both prompts simultaneously with similar prospect segments</li>
<li>Ensure statistically significant sample size (minimum 100 conversations per variant)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Analyze Results</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compare performance across primary and secondary metrics</li>
<li>Look for patterns in conversation flows and prospect responses</li>
<li>Identify which variant performs better and why</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Implement and Iterate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adopt the winning variant as your new baseline</li>
<li>Develop new test based on insights gained</li>
<li>Continue testing process with another variable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example A/B Test Results</h3>
<p><strong>Test Variable:</strong> Opening message approach</p>
<p><strong>Variant A (Control):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Start with a brief company introduction followed by a question about their challenges with [relevant process].
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Variant B (Test):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Begin with an industry-specific statistic about the cost of [pain point], then ask if they&#39;re experiencing similar issues.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Variant A: 12% engagement rate, 8% appointment set rate</li>
<li>Variant B: 17% engagement rate, 11% appointment set rate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Insight:</strong> The industry statistic approach created more compelling opening conversations by immediately establishing relevance and creating curiosity.</p>

<h3>What&#39;s the ideal length for an AI appointment setting prompt?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Comprehensive prompts typically range from 500-1,500 words. The ideal length depends on conversation complexity and number of variables. Focus on completeness rather than brevity—include all necessary context, qualification criteria, objection handling, and personality guidance. It&#39;s better to have a longer, more detailed prompt than a concise one that leaves your AI without critical instructions.</p>
<h3>How often should I update my AI appointment setting prompts?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Implement a regular review cycle based on conversation volume:</p>
<ul>
<li>High volume (1,000+ conversations/week): Weekly reviews and adjustments</li>
<li>Medium volume (200-1,000/week): Bi-weekly optimization</li>
<li>Low volume (under 200/week): Monthly refinement</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, always update prompts when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product offerings or messaging changes</li>
<li>Market conditions shift significantly</li>
<li>New objections emerge consistently</li>
<li>Appointment show rates decline</li>
<li>Sales team provides feedback on lead quality</li>
</ul>
<h3>Can AI effectively handle complex B2B appointment setting?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, with proper prompt engineering. For complex B2B scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide detailed industry context and terminology</li>
<li>Include multi-stage qualification criteria</li>
<li>Create sophisticated objection handling paths</li>
<li>Incorporate relevant use cases and ROI calculations</li>
<li>Add instructions for navigating stakeholder dynamics</li>
</ol>
<p>The most successful implementations combine AI for initial engagement and qualification with human SDRs for later-stage conversations with complex enterprise prospects.</p>
<h3>How transparent should my AI be about being an AI?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Always be transparent. Instruct your AI to identify itself as an AI assistant in the initial interaction. Research shows that transparency doesn&#39;t harm effectiveness when coupled with personalization and value. Some effective approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I&#39;m [Name], an AI assistant with [Company]...&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;This is [Company]&#39;s AI assistant reaching out about...&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Deceptive practices damage trust and may violate emerging AI regulations.</p>
<h3>What&#39;s the biggest difference between human SDR scripts and AI prompts?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Human scripts focus on what to say, while effective AI prompts must also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contextual understanding guidance</li>
<li>Response variations for different scenarios</li>
<li>Personality and tone instructions</li>
<li>Conversation flow logic</li>
<li>Error handling directions</li>
<li>Qualification decision-making parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>AI prompts require more comprehensive planning because AI doesn&#39;t have human intuition to fill gaps or adapt naturally to unexpected responses.</p>
<h3>How do I balance personalization with scalability?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Create a tiered personalization framework:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Automated personalization:</strong> Instruct AI to incorporate readily available data (name, company, title, industry, tech stack)</li>
<li><strong>Semi-automated enrichment:</strong> Use tools like Clearbit or ZoomInfo to gather additional insights that AI can reference</li>
<li><strong>Selective human enhancement:</strong> Have SDRs add custom notes for high-value prospects only</li>
<li><strong>Personalization triggers:</strong> Create rules that determine personalization depth based on prospect value</li>
</ol>
<p>The key is defining which prospects deserve deeper personalization investment versus using scalable, automated approaches.</p>
<h3>What tone works best for AI appointment setting?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Tests consistently show that conversational professional tone outperforms both overly formal and extremely casual approaches. Your prompt should instruct the AI to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use natural language without jargon or buzzwords</li>
<li>Keep messages concise (3-5 sentences per response)</li>
<li>Ask questions that advance the conversation</li>
<li>Match the prospect&#39;s communication style</li>
<li>Avoid excessive enthusiasm or punctuation</li>
</ul>
<p>Industry context matters—financial services and healthcare typically require more professional tone than creative industries or technology.</p>
<h3>How do I handle regulatory compliance in AI appointment setting prompts?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Include specific compliance guidelines in your prompts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add industry-specific compliance requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, FINRA, etc.)</li>
<li>Include required disclosures or disclaimers</li>
<li>Specify data handling restrictions</li>
<li>Add prohibited claims or promises</li>
<li>Include guidance on documentation requirements</li>
</ol>
<p>For highly regulated industries, implement human review processes for conversations and regular compliance audits of your prompts.</p>
