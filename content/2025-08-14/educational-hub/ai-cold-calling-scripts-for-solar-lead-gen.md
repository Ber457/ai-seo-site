### Step 5: Create Your Base AI Scripts

Develop these core script components that your AI system will adapt and optimize:

**1. Segment-specific opening lines:**

*For environmentalists:*
"Hi [Name], I noticed your community in [Neighborhood] has been leading the way in sustainability initiatives. I'm calling because your home has exceptional solar potential that could reduce carbon emissions by approximately [X] tons annually."

*For cost-focused homeowners:*
"Hi [Name], I'm calling about a specific opportunity for homeowners in [Zip Code] where recent utility rate increases of [X%] have made solar particularly valuable. Based on your roof's characteristics, you could potentially save [estimated range] monthly."

*For energy independence seekers:*
"Hi [Name], with the increasing grid reliability issues in [Region], I'm reaching out to homeowners like you who might benefit from energy independence. Your property's solar profile indicates you could offset approximately [X%] of your energy needs."

**2. Value proposition frameworks:**

*Financial framework:*
"Based on our analysis of homes with similar [size/energy usage/roof characteristics] in [Neighborhood], our customers are seeing an average of [X%] reduction in electricity costs. With current [local/federal] incentives, the payback period is typically [X-Y years], after which the system essentially generates free electricity for 25+ years."

*Property value framework:*
"Recent studies show homes with owned solar systems sell for [X%] more than comparable non-solar homes. Combined with the monthly savings of approximately [amount], solar becomes both an immediate cost reduction and a long-term investment in your property value."

*Environmental impact framework:*
"A system sized for your home would prevent approximately [X] pounds of CO2 emissions annually, equivalent to [planting Y trees/removing Z cars from the road]. Many of our customers find this environmental benefit as valuable as the financial savings."

**3. Qualification question sequences:**

```
Q1: "Just to confirm, you're the homeowner at [address], correct?"
   If YES → Continue
   If NO → "Is the homeowner available? When would be a good time to reach them?"

Q2: "Would you mind sharing your average monthly electric bill during summer months?"
   If $150-300 → High potential, flag for emphasis on savings
   If $300+ → Very high potential, emphasize rapid ROI
   If <$150 → Moderate potential, focus on other benefits

Q3: "Has anyone from a solar company assessed your home's solar potential before?"
   If YES → "What was your experience? What kept you from moving forward?"
   If NO → "We've done a preliminary analysis that shows strong potential because [property-specific reason]"
```

**4. Objection handling modules:**

*For "too expensive" objections:*
"I understand cost is a major consideration. Many homeowners don't realize that with current federal tax credits of 30% and [local incentive], you can get started with $0 down financing options where the monthly payment is typically [X-Y%] less than your current electric bill. Would you like to see what those numbers look like specifically for your home?"

*For "waiting for better technology" objections:*
"That's a thoughtful approach. What many homeowners don't realize is that today's panels are already 3-4 times more efficient than panels from 10 years ago, with warranties of 25+ years. The current incentives of [specific incentives] actually make today's technology more cost-effective than waiting, as those incentives are scheduled to decrease over time. Would you be open to seeing an analysis that compares installing now versus waiting?"

*For "need to think about it" objections:*
"I completely understand wanting to give this proper consideration. Most homeowners we work with spend 2-3 weeks researching before making a decision. To help with that process, we offer a no-obligation custom proposal that shows exactly what the system would look like on your roof, the expected production, and detailed financial projections. This gives you the specific information you need to make an informed decision. Could I set that up for you?"
