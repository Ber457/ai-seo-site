- **Voice Cloning Regulations:** The use of synthetic or cloned voices in AI calls may trigger specific disclosure requirements under emerging regulations.

## Implementing a Compliance-Focused AI Cold Calling Strategy

### Building Compliant AI Call Scripts

Creating scripts for AI-powered cold calling requires careful attention to compliance details:

1. **Clear Identification:** Scripts must be programmed to identify the caller and organization within the first few seconds.
2. **Mandatory Disclosures:** Include all required disclosures about the purpose of the call and nature of the offering.
3. **Opt-Out Mechanisms:** Design scripts with clear, easy-to-use opt-out options that the AI can process accurately.
4. **Consent Verification:** Include language to verify and document consent when appropriate.

Example script elements might include:

```
"Hello, this is [Name] calling on behalf of [Company]. This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance. You're receiving this call because [basis for contact/consent]."

"At any time during this call, you can say 'opt out' or 'remove me' to be added to our Do-Not-Call list."
```

### Training and Monitoring AI Systems for Compliance

Ensuring ongoing compliance requires:

- **Regular Compliance Audits:** Schedule periodic reviews of AI cold calling operations to ensure they remain compliant with evolving regulations.
